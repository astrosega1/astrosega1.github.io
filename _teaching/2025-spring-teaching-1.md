Summary
-----------
In this course, engineering and science majors will learn about the basic laws of motion in classical mechanics. They will learn how and why objects in our day-to-day move (or stay put) the way that they do, and will know how to predict projectile and rotational motion. They will also learn about the nature of scientific laws and the statistical nature of scientific measurements.

There's a lot more information about this course -- including details about the textbook, who should/shouldn't take this class, and how your grade is calculated -- in the [syllabus](../files/PHY2048C.pdf).

Course Material
--------------
The primary "required readings" are in the OpenStax book [University Physics 1](https://openstax.org/details/books/university-physics-volume-1) and the first section (thermodynamics) of [University Physics 2](https://openstax.org/details/books/university-physics-volume-2). For one of our experiments in this class (Lab 5), you will be using your phone, and the app phyphox, which you can download [here](https://phyphox.org).

Here are some additional resources:

* An excellent, more abridged e-book for this course is available through the FSU Library [Fundamental of Physics I](https://fsu-flvc.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/openurl?institution=01FALSC_FSU&vid=01FALSC_FSU:Home&isbn=9780300243772&genre=book&eisbn=9780300249583&title=Fundamentals%20of%20Physics%20I&sid=jstor:jstor). Give it a try if the OpenStax book treatment of a topic does not click with you. Ramamurti Shankar writes in a very particular voice that can help some students.
* This book is based on R. Shankar's [Open Course](https://oyc.yale.edu/physics/phys-200) (Yale University), which is available online. These lectures were, and still are, a helpful resource for me.
* The phone app *phyphox* will be required in some of the labs, download [here](https://phyphox.org/download/).
* Here is a [worksheet](../files/verbalal.pdf) to practice verbal algebra problems. Problems like this will be use to test your ability of translating English and concepts into equations, an essential skill in this class.
